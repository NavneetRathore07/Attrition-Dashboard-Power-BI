# Employee Attrition Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains a **Power BI dashboard** project that analyzes employee attrition patterns for **Green Destinations**, a well-known travel agency. The objective of the analysis is to uncover trends and factors influencing employee turnover, focusing on various demographics, job details, and personal factors.

This project was completed as part of my internship at **Unified Mentor Pvt. Ltd**. Using employee data provided by Green Destinations, I performed data analysis using Power BI, implementing DAX calculations, and created interactive visualizations to assist HR in understanding and mitigating employee attrition.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:
1. **Calculating the overall attrition rate** â€” the percentage of employees who have left the company.
2. **Analyzing key factors that influence attrition**, such as:
   - Age
   - Tenure (years at the company)
   - Job role
   - Department
   - Monthly income
3. Providing additional insights into other factors like gender, marital status, business travel frequency, and education field, and how these relate to employee attrition.

## Dashboard Features

### Key Metrics
- **Overall Attrition Rate**: Displayed using a prominent card visual to show the percentage of employees who left.
- **Total Employees**: A card visual showing the total count of employees in the dataset.
- **Employees Who Left**: A card visual that displays the number of employees who left during the analysis period.
- **Attrition by Years at Company (Tenure)**: A card visual that displays the Average years spent at the company by Employee

### Visual Analysis
- **Attrition by Age Group**: A column chart that highlights attrition rates across different age groups, helping to identify the most vulnerable age segments.
- **Attrition by Job Role**: A clustered bar chart displaying the attrition rates across different job roles such as Sales Executive, Research Scientist, and Manager.
- **Attrition by Department**: A column chart where users can switch between departments using interactive buttons, offering an in-depth look into attrition across Sales, Research & Development, and Human Resources.
- **Attrition by Monthly Income**: A scatter plot showing the relationship between monthly income and employee attrition, providing insights into whether higher or lower salaries impact turnover rates.
- **Attrition by Years at Company (Tenure)**: A line chart that visualizes how years spent at the company influence the likelihood of leaving.

### Additional Insights
- **Attrition by Gender**: A pie chart visualizing the distribution of male and female employees who left the company.
- **Attrition by Marital Status**: A clustered bar chart that shows how marital status (Single, Married, Divorced) affects attrition rates.
- **Attrition by Business Travel**: A column chart showing the breakdown of attrition based on business travel frequency (e.g., Travel Frequently, Travel Rarely, Non-Travel).
- **Attrition by Distance from Home**: A bar chart that analyzes whether commute distance affects an employee's decision to leave.

### Interactivity
- **Buttons for Department Filtering**: Instead of using slicers, **buttons** are used to allow users to switch between different departments. These buttons help to focus the analysis on specific departments, offering tailored insights for each one.
